# Cplusplus-Program.

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
#This program tracks the frequency of items in a text file and allows the user to interact with the data through a menu. The program defines a class called ItemTracker, which contains a private member variable frequency, which is a map that maps each item to its frequency. The constructor of the ItemTracker class reads in a text file called "CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt" and updates the frequency map for each item in the file. 
#The ItemTracker class has three member functions:
#getFrequency(string item) which returns the frequency of a given item. 
#printList() which prints out the list of items and their frequencies. 
#printHistogram() which prints out a histogram of the frequencies of the items.

#What did you do particularly well?
#This was my first program that involved two different languages. I had to do a lot more digging research wise but overall was satified I understood what was going on in these situations. 

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I currently dont know how I could. I'm absolutly sure there is. Theres many ways to write the code but none of which are majorly more effiecient. 

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The merging of two languages took me hours to grasp after watching many videos and reading an article or two.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Most likely the use of multiple languages into one project. I now understand the reason why you'd want to call on another language while inside of a different one. In our situation python was better suited to skim through files and get us our answer than C++ would've been.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I took many breaks throughout my day. This sounds lazy but it allows me to break everything down into bite sized pieces. Makes readign articles and watching videos more bearable for hours on end.
